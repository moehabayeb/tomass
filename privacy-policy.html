    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Microphone and Speech Recognition</h2>
    <p>Our App uses your device's microphone for speech recognition during speaking exercises. Microphone access requires your explicit permission. Audio is processed in real-time and is not recorded or stored on our servers. Only aggregated performance metrics (such as duration and score) are saved.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase with row-level security, ensuring you can only access your own data. All data transmission is encrypted via HTTPS. Chat history and conversation messages are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> - Authentication and data storage</li>
        <li><strong>Amplitude</strong> - Analytics (opt-in only)</li>
        <li><strong>Sentry</strong> - Error tracking (opt-in only)</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store / Google Play Store</strong> - In-app purchases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We require age verification before allowing access to the App, in compliance with COPPA regulations. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

        <li>Access your personal data</li>

        <li>Opt out of analytics tracking at any time</li>
        <li>Delete your account and all associated data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you sign out, all locally stored data is cleared from your device.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data from our servers within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
