✅ Understand how to convert direct speech to reported speech using different tenses.
✅ Recognize tense changes and pronoun shifts in reported speech.
✅ Respond accurately and fluently using reported speech.

Reported Speech is used to express what someone said without quoting their exact words. When we report speech, we usually change the tense of the original sentence (backshift), pronouns, time expressions, and word order if necessary.

🧩 Structure
✅ He/She said (that) + subject + verb (with backshift as needed)

🧠 Example Sentences
• Present Simple → Past Simple: "I work here." → He said he worked there.
• Present Continuous → Past Continuous
• Present Perfect → Past Perfect
• Past Simple → Past Perfect
• Future Simple (will) → would
• “I’m tired.” → He said (that) he was tired.
