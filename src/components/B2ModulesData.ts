Reported Speech is used to express what someone said without quoting their exact words. When we report speech, we usually change the tense of the original sentence (backshift), pronouns, time expressions, and word order if necessary.

🧠 Example Sentences
• Present Simple → Past Simple: "I work here." → He said he worked there.
• Present Continuous → Past Continuous
• Present Perfect → Past Perfect
• Past Simple → Past Perfect
• Future Simple (will) → would
• "I'm tired." → He said (that) he was tired.

✅ Learn how to describe trends and changes over time
✅ Use correct vocabulary for increases, decreases, and fluctuations

📗 Topic Explanation
Today we're going to learn how to describe trends — how things change over time. This is especially useful when talking about statistics, reports, and real-life situations, like population growth, sales, weather, or prices.

We'll focus on three main types of trends:
• Increase (go up, rise, grow)
• Decrease (go down, fall, drop)
• Fluctuate (go up and down)

When we describe trends, we often use verbs, nouns, and adverbs together to make our speech sound natural.

🧩 Useful Phrases for Describing Trends

📊 UPWARD MOVEMENT:
• Verbs: rise, increase, go up, grow
• Nouns: a rise, an increase
• Adverbs/Adjectives: sharply, steadily, gradually, slightly

📉 DOWNWARD MOVEMENT:
• Verbs: fall, drop, decrease, decline
• Nouns: a fall, a decrease
• Adverbs/Adjectives: dramatically, slightly, rapidly

📈 FLUCTUATION / STABILITY:
• Verbs: fluctuate, vary, remain stable
• Nouns: fluctuation, stability
• Adverbs/Adjectives: slightly, constantly, consistently

  description: "Learn to talk naturally about percentages, fractions, and proportions in everyday English",
  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives
✅ Talk naturally about percentages, fractions, and proportions
✅ Describe surveys, facts, and simple data confidently
✅ Make statistics sound conversational, not robotic

📗 Topic Explanation
Today, we're going to talk about statistics — don't worry, not in a boring math way! We'll learn how to use English to describe numbers, percentages, and fractions when we talk about real life things.

You'll see, it's actually something we do every day without realizing it. For example, we say things like:
• "Almost half of my friends drink coffee every morning."
• "One in three people I know has a pet."
• "About 70 percent of my students prefer learning online."

Let's make statistics sound natural and human, not robotic!

🧩 Useful Language for Talking About Statistics
• Around 60 percent of people... / Almost everyone...
• Only a small number of people... / A tiny fraction...
• One third, a quarter, half — to make data sound smoother in speech
• about, around, nearly, just over, just under for natural approximations

🧠 Natural Examples
• "Just under half of the students passed" sounds more natural than "48% of the students passed."`,

Formal English is used in professional, academic, or polite situations, while informal English is used with friends, family, or casual chats. Let's learn how to switch between the two naturally!

// Module 172 Data: Direct and Indirect Speech Review
const MODULE_172_DATA = {
  title: "Direct and Indirect Speech Review",
  description: "Master reporting what other people said using both direct and indirect speech",
  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives
✅ Report what other people said confidently
✅ Use both direct and indirect (reported) speech naturally
✅ Apply pronoun changes, tense shifts, and time/place changes correctly

📗 Topic Explanation
Today we're reviewing one of the most practical topics in English — Direct and Indirect Speech.

We use DIRECT SPEECH when we quote someone's exact words:
→ She said, "I'm tired."

We use INDIRECT (REPORTED) SPEECH when we report what someone said without quoting:
→ She said (that) she was tired.

In everyday English, we often switch from direct to indirect when retelling stories, gossip, or news.

🧩 Key Rules to Remember
• PRONOUN CHANGES: "I" → "he/she," "my" → "his/her," etc.
• TENSE SHIFTS (Backshifting):
  - am/is → was
  - are → were
  - do/does → did
  - have/has → had
  - will → would
  - can → could
  - may → might

• TIME AND PLACE CHANGES:
  - today → that day
  - tomorrow → the next day
  - yesterday → the day before
  - here → there
  - this → that`,

  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives
✅ Use polite, indirect, and respectful language in English
✅ Make requests, refusals, and suggestions politely

📗 Topic Explanation
Today we're going to learn how to sound polite in English. Being polite isn't just about saying "please" and "thank you" — it's about how you ask, refuse, suggest, or correct someone without sounding rude.

For example:
• Direct: "Give me that pen."
• Polite: "Could you please pass me the pen?"

Politeness is very important in English-speaking cultures. Even when people disagree, they often soften their language.

🧩 Common Politeness Strategies
• Use softeners: "Could you please...?", "Would you mind...?"
• Add "please" and "thank you" naturally
• Use indirect language: "It's a bit cold in here, isn't it?"
• Apologize when interrupting: "I'm sorry to interrupt, but..."

  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives
✅ Describe people and places vividly and naturally
✅ Use advanced adjectives and idiomatic expressions

📗 Topic Explanation
Today we're going to focus on describing people and places — but not in a simple way like "He is tall" or "The place is nice."

We're going to take your English to the next level by learning how to paint pictures with words.

When describing PEOPLE, think about: appearance, personality, emotions, and habits.
When describing PLACES, think about: atmosphere, size, colors, sounds, smells, and feelings.

Here's the secret: good descriptions make your listener see, hear, and feel what you're describing.

• He seemed completely lost in thought.

  description: "Express logical guesses about past events using modal verbs: must have, might have, could have, can't have",
  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives
✅ Express logical guesses about past events
✅ Use modal verbs + have + past participle correctly
✅ Show different degrees of certainty about the past

📗 Topic Explanation
Today we're going to learn how to talk about things that happened in the past — when we aren't completely sure what actually happened. We call this "speculating about the past."

We use modal verbs + have + past participle to express degrees of certainty:
• MUST HAVE (almost sure)
• MIGHT HAVE / MAY HAVE (possible)
• COULD HAVE (possible, often when something didn't happen)
• CAN'T HAVE (sure it didn't happen)

🧠 Examples
• He must have been tired after that long trip.
• She might have left already.
• They could have taken a taxi instead.
• He can't have done it alone.`,

Today we're going to learn how to talk about imaginary situations in the past — things that didn't happen, but could have. We use these structures to express regret, imagination, or criticism.
