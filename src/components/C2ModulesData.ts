    { question: "How do cultural differences affect humor interpretation?", answer: "Humor depends on shared assumptions. British understatement may seem cold to Americans, while slapstick humor may appear immature to some cultures." },
    { question: "Why is timing essential in humor?", answer: "Humor relies on rhythm and anticipation. A perfectly timed pause before the punchline transforms language into performance." },
    { question: "How can humor serve as social criticism?", answer: "Satire and parody use laughter as a mirror to expose injustice, hypocrisy, and moral absurdity while keeping audiences entertained." },

    { question: "How can humor fail across cultures?", answer: "Without shared knowledge, jokes lose meaning or offend. The same phrase can provoke laughter or discomfort depending on context." },
    { question: "How does tone convey sarcasm?", answer: "Tone is the soul of sarcasm. Flat delivery or exaggerated stress signals that literal meaning is inverted." },
    { question: "What role does irony play in literature?", answer: "It deepens narrative complexity by juxtaposing appearance and reality, forcing readers to uncover deeper truths." },
    { question: "Why do some societies embrace dark humor?", answer: "Because laughter transforms fear into resilience. In tragedy, humor offers emotional distance and survival." },
    { question: "How does sarcasm reveal power dynamics?", answer: "Sarcasm often reflects hierarchy — the powerful mock the weak, or vice versa. It can affirm control or challenge authority." },
    { question: "How does understatement create humor?", answer: "By saying less than expected, understatement invites listeners to perceive the unspoken truth — a hallmark of British irony." },
    { question: "What is the danger of humor in formal contexts?", answer: "Misjudged humor can appear unprofessional or disrespectful. In diplomacy or business, tone is everything." },
    { question: "How is humor used politically?", answer: "Politicians use humor strategically to deflect criticism, humanize themselves, or subtly ridicule opponents." },
    { question: "How can irony make serious subjects approachable?", answer: "Irony uses laughter to lower defenses, allowing difficult issues to be explored safely and thoughtfully." },
    { question: "Why is satire considered intellectual humor?", answer: "It requires cultural knowledge and inferential thinking. Recognizing satire means perceiving both surface and subtext." },
    { question: "Why is context crucial for sarcasm?", answer: "Because meaning depends on shared understanding — without it, sarcasm becomes confusion or offense." },
    { question: "How can humor unite people socially?", answer: "Shared laughter creates bonding, reducing tension and reinforcing group identity across differences." },
    { question: "What links intelligence and humor?", answer: "Both rely on recognizing patterns, contradictions, and absurdities — humor is the wit of reason." },

    { question: "How does humor evolve with education?", answer: "Intellectual maturity favors layered humor — irony, wordplay, and cultural allusion over slapstick." },
    { question: "Why is sarcasm called the 'lowest form of wit'?", answer: "Because it can be cruel and superficial, yet when used wisely, it transforms pain into insight." },

    { question: "Why do jokes lose power in translation?", answer: "Humor depends on cultural idioms, wordplay, and timing — all language-specific elements." },
    { question: "Can irony express sincerity?", answer: "Yes — by highlighting absurdity, irony can underscore truth, revealing authenticity through contrast." },
    { question: "How is humor tied to empathy?", answer: "It requires awareness of others' feelings and boundaries, balancing laughter with respect." },
    { question: "How does irony appear in social media?", answer: "Through memes, exaggerated tone, and emojis that signal nonliteral intent — a digital evolution of sarcasm." },
    { question: "Why does self-deprecating humor build credibility?", answer: "Because it signals emotional security and transparency — the confident can afford to laugh at themselves." },
    { question: "What linguistic structures reveal sarcasm?", answer: "Inversion, hyperbole, and positive phrasing with negative tone — often recognizable by prosody alone." },
    { question: "How do authors use dramatic irony?", answer: "Readers know truths that characters do not — creating tension, humor, or empathy through awareness." },
    { question: "How is humor both inclusive and exclusive?", answer: "It unites insiders through shared understanding but excludes outsiders unaware of the reference." },
    { question: "Why does irony thrive during crises?", answer: "Humor becomes resilience — a psychological shield that turns despair into shared strength." },

  title: "Module 260 - Advanced Collocations – Nuanced Usage",
  description: "Transform fluent speech into eloquent expression through mastery of natural word combinations",
  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives

✅ Master sophisticated collocational awareness across formal and informal registers
✅ Use natural word combinations to convey nuance, tone, and authenticity
✅ Recognize habitual pairings that signal true linguistic sophistication
✅ Achieve near-native fluency through instinctive collocational choice

At the C2 level, mastering collocations transforms a speaker from fluent to eloquent. Collocations are natural combinations of words that convey nuance, tone, and authenticity — the hallmark of true linguistic sophistication. This module explores advanced collocational awareness through examples, analysis, and detailed discussion.`,
  table: {
    title: "📋 Advanced Collocation Types",
    data: [
      { type: "Verb + Noun", example_collocations: "pose a threat, draw a conclusion, shoulder responsibility, bear fruit", register_tone: "Formal / Academic" },
      { type: "Adjective + Noun", example_collocations: "palpable tension, resounding success, unwavering loyalty, sheer determination", register_tone: "Elevated / Emotional" },
      { type: "Noun + Noun", example_collocations: "window of opportunity, sense of urgency, matter of principle, turning point", register_tone: "Neutral / Professional" },
      { type: "Adverb + Adjective", example_collocations: "deeply rooted, highly unlikely, painfully aware, profoundly grateful", register_tone: "Academic / Emotional" },
      { type: "Verb + Adverb", example_collocations: "deny categorically, agree wholeheartedly, apologize sincerely, admire deeply", register_tone: "Formal / Expressive" }

  speakingPractice: [
    { question: "Why do collocations represent linguistic sophistication?", answer: "Because they reveal an instinctive awareness of natural language rhythm, sound, and idiomatic precision rather than memorized grammar." },
    { question: "How do collocations reflect cultural thought?", answer: "Each language conceptualizes experience differently: English 'makes' a decision, French 'takes' one, reflecting unique worldviews." },
    { question: "What distinguishes 'strong coffee' from 'powerful coffee'?", answer: "Only the first is idiomatic. Collocations are guided by habitual association, not logic or translation." },
    { question: "How can collocations refine academic writing?", answer: "They replace simple expressions with elegant precision: 'a big problem' becomes 'a pressing issue' or 'a major concern'." },
    { question: "Why is literal translation dangerous in collocations?", answer: "Because it transfers structure rather than style, resulting in unnatural phrases like 'do a mistake' instead of 'make a mistake'." },
    { question: "How do collocations vary across registers?", answer: "Formal writing uses 'undertake research,' while conversation prefers 'do research' — register determines naturalness." },
    { question: "Why does 'wreak havoc' endure as a collocation?", answer: "It retains medieval metaphorical roots, reflecting historical idiomatic stability in English." },
    { question: "Why do certain adjectives naturally pair with certain nouns?", answer: "Sound, rhythm, and semantic association reinforce conventional pairings over time, creating linguistic expectations." },
    { question: "How does mastery of collocations enhance fluency?", answer: "Fluent speakers retrieve word groups as single units, improving flow and speed of speech." },
    { question: "What is a 'lexical chunk'?", answer: "A prefabricated word group like 'as a matter of fact' — collocations are the foundation of such fluency." },
    { question: "Why are collocations critical in academic evaluation?", answer: "They demonstrate control of nuance and tone — features examiners associate with near-native proficiency." },
    { question: "How do idioms differ from collocations?", answer: "Idioms are figurative and opaque, while collocations are literal but habitual combinations." },
    { question: "How can collocations affect persuasion?", answer: "They strengthen tone — 'mounting evidence' or 'irrefutable proof' sound authoritative." },
    { question: "Why does 'utter failure' sound stronger than 'complete failure'?", answer: "The alliteration and archaic tone of 'utter' intensify emotion beyond degree alone." },
    { question: "What gives 'deeply rooted tradition' its strength?", answer: "The metaphor of roots creates imagery of time and identity, making it emotionally resonant." },
    { question: "How do collocations enhance professional credibility?", answer: "They align speech with expected register — 'implement policy' signals precision and competence." },
    { question: "Why avoid overusing 'very'?", answer: "Advanced collocations carry built-in emphasis — 'highly effective' or 'utterly exhausted' sound more polished." },
    { question: "Why is 'bear fruit' an idiomatic collocation?", answer: "It fuses metaphor and action, representing success as natural growth." },
    { question: "How can collocational mistakes break fluency?", answer: "Errors like 'powerful rain' create cognitive dissonance, distracting from meaning." },
    { question: "What psychological principle explains collocational recall?", answer: "The brain stores habitual word pairings as single semantic units for instant retrieval." },
    { question: "How do collocations enrich emotional writing?", answer: "They offer subtle gradation — 'quiet despair' differs from 'deep sadness' in emotional intensity." },
    { question: "How to identify collocations naturally?", answer: "Through exposure and noticing — repeated patterns across authentic reading materials reveal them intuitively." },
    { question: "How do collocations differ regionally?", answer: "British speakers 'take decisions' while Americans 'make' them, illustrating cultural divergence in usage." },
    { question: "How does sound influence collocation order?", answer: "Phonetic flow favors combinations like 'black and white' over 'white and black' — rhythm dictates preference." },
    { question: "Why is collocational knowledge C2-level mastery?", answer: "It proves that structure and style merge into intuition — true linguistic maturity." },
    { question: "How do metaphor and collocation overlap?", answer: "Many collocations are fossilized metaphors — 'grasp an idea' originates from physical action imagery." },
    { question: "Why is 'make an effort' idiomatic but 'do an effort' not?", answer: "Historical linguistic evolution fixed certain verbs with nouns through habitual use." },
    { question: "Why do some collocations sound musical?", answer: "English rhythm favors alliteration and contrast: 'safe and sound,' 'fast and furious,' etc." },
    { question: "What is 'collocational range'?", answer: "The breadth of natural pairings a word allows — 'strong' with 'coffee,' 'argument,' 'desire,' but not 'rain'." },
    { question: "Why does 'commit a crime' sound heavier than 'do a crime'?", answer: "Lexical choice carries moral and legal gravity; collocation defines register." },
    { question: "How do collocations create vivid imagery?", answer: "Metaphorical pairs like 'light a spark' energize abstract concepts with sensory appeal." },
    { question: "What nuance separates 'narrow escape' and 'lucky escape'?", answer: "'Narrow' evokes proximity to danger, while 'lucky' focuses on chance — micro-differences in tone." },
    { question: "How does register affect collocational choice?", answer: "Formal English: 'express concern'; informal: 'show worry' — mastery means adapting tone fluidly." },
    { question: "Why is 'resounding success' vivid?", answer: "It engages sound metaphor — 'resounding' implies echo and scale, making success feel amplified." },
    { question: "Why prefer collocations over synonyms?", answer: "Because collocations sound natural — 'take action' feels idiomatic; 'make action' does not." },
    { question: "How does collocation mastery improve listening?", answer: "It enables instant comprehension by chunking predictable patterns of speech." },
    { question: "Why learn collocations thematically?", answer: "Grouping by context (e.g., work, travel, emotion) mirrors how language is stored and recalled." },
    { question: "How do collocations elevate everyday English?", answer: "They refine tone — 'utterly exhausted' sounds precise where 'very tired' sounds flat." },
    { question: "Why does translation demand collocational awareness?", answer: "Direct translation destroys idiomaticity — each language combines words differently to sound authentic." },
    { question: "What marks full mastery of collocations?", answer: "The ability to select precise combinations instinctively across registers — from poetic to technical language." }
