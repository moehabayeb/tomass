    { question: "How do cultural differences affect humor interpretation?", answer: "Humor depends on shared assumptions. British understatement may seem cold to Americans, while slapstick humor may appear immature to some cultures." },
    { question: "Why is timing essential in humor?", answer: "Humor relies on rhythm and anticipation. A perfectly timed pause before the punchline transforms language into performance." },
    { question: "How can humor serve as social criticism?", answer: "Satire and parody use laughter as a mirror to expose injustice, hypocrisy, and moral absurdity while keeping audiences entertained." },

    { question: "How can humor fail across cultures?", answer: "Without shared knowledge, jokes lose meaning or offend. The same phrase can provoke laughter or discomfort depending on context." },
    { question: "How does tone convey sarcasm?", answer: "Tone is the soul of sarcasm. Flat delivery or exaggerated stress signals that literal meaning is inverted." },
    { question: "What role does irony play in literature?", answer: "It deepens narrative complexity by juxtaposing appearance and reality, forcing readers to uncover deeper truths." },
    { question: "Why do some societies embrace dark humor?", answer: "Because laughter transforms fear into resilience. In tragedy, humor offers emotional distance and survival." },
    { question: "How does sarcasm reveal power dynamics?", answer: "Sarcasm often reflects hierarchy — the powerful mock the weak, or vice versa. It can affirm control or challenge authority." },
    { question: "How does understatement create humor?", answer: "By saying less than expected, understatement invites listeners to perceive the unspoken truth — a hallmark of British irony." },
    { question: "What is the danger of humor in formal contexts?", answer: "Misjudged humor can appear unprofessional or disrespectful. In diplomacy or business, tone is everything." },
    { question: "How is humor used politically?", answer: "Politicians use humor strategically to deflect criticism, humanize themselves, or subtly ridicule opponents." },
    { question: "How can irony make serious subjects approachable?", answer: "Irony uses laughter to lower defenses, allowing difficult issues to be explored safely and thoughtfully." },
    { question: "Why is satire considered intellectual humor?", answer: "It requires cultural knowledge and inferential thinking. Recognizing satire means perceiving both surface and subtext." },
    { question: "Why is context crucial for sarcasm?", answer: "Because meaning depends on shared understanding — without it, sarcasm becomes confusion or offense." },
    { question: "How can humor unite people socially?", answer: "Shared laughter creates bonding, reducing tension and reinforcing group identity across differences." },
    { question: "What links intelligence and humor?", answer: "Both rely on recognizing patterns, contradictions, and absurdities — humor is the wit of reason." },

    { question: "How does humor evolve with education?", answer: "Intellectual maturity favors layered humor — irony, wordplay, and cultural allusion over slapstick." },
    { question: "Why is sarcasm called the 'lowest form of wit'?", answer: "Because it can be cruel and superficial, yet when used wisely, it transforms pain into insight." },

    { question: "Why do jokes lose power in translation?", answer: "Humor depends on cultural idioms, wordplay, and timing — all language-specific elements." },
    { question: "Can irony express sincerity?", answer: "Yes — by highlighting absurdity, irony can underscore truth, revealing authenticity through contrast." },
    { question: "How is humor tied to empathy?", answer: "It requires awareness of others' feelings and boundaries, balancing laughter with respect." },
    { question: "How does irony appear in social media?", answer: "Through memes, exaggerated tone, and emojis that signal nonliteral intent — a digital evolution of sarcasm." },
    { question: "Why does self-deprecating humor build credibility?", answer: "Because it signals emotional security and transparency — the confident can afford to laugh at themselves." },
    { question: "What linguistic structures reveal sarcasm?", answer: "Inversion, hyperbole, and positive phrasing with negative tone — often recognizable by prosody alone." },
    { question: "How do authors use dramatic irony?", answer: "Readers know truths that characters do not — creating tension, humor, or empathy through awareness." },
    { question: "How is humor both inclusive and exclusive?", answer: "It unites insiders through shared understanding but excludes outsiders unaware of the reference." },
    { question: "Why does irony thrive during crises?", answer: "Humor becomes resilience — a psychological shield that turns despair into shared strength." },

    { question: "Is accent reduction necessary?", answer: "Only if intelligibility is genuinely compromised — many accents are perfectly clear and don't need modification." },
    { question: "What are common pronunciation challenges for learners?", answer: "Distinguishing /r/ and /l/, /th/ sounds, vowel length, word stress, and intonation patterns." },
    { question: "How can you improve pronunciation clarity?", answer: "Practice minimal pairs, record yourself, focus on word stress and intonation, and listen actively to native speakers." },
    { question: "What are minimal pairs?", answer: "Word pairs differing by one sound, like 'ship/sheep' or 'bit/beat', used to practice sound distinctions." },
    { question: "Why is word stress important?", answer: "Incorrect stress can confuse meaning — 'REcord' (noun) vs. 'reCORD' (verb) are different words." },
    { question: "How does intonation affect meaning?", answer: "Rising intonation signals questions; falling signals statements — misusing it can confuse listeners." },
    { question: "Can you have a strong accent and still be fluent?", answer: "Absolutely — fluency is about communication effectiveness, not sounding native." },
    { question: "What is the Lingua Franca Core?", answer: "A set of pronunciation features deemed essential for international intelligibility in English." },
    { question: "What does the Lingua Franca Core prioritize?", answer: "Consonant clarity, vowel length contrasts, and nuclear stress — not native-like accent." },
    { question: "Should learners imitate a specific accent?", answer: "Only if desired for personal or professional reasons — otherwise, focus on clarity and consistency." },
    { question: "How does exposure improve pronunciation?", answer: "Listening to diverse accents trains the ear and helps internalize natural rhythm, stress, and intonation." },
    { question: "Can shadowing help with accent?", answer: "Yes — repeating speech immediately after hearing it (shadowing) improves rhythm, stress, and fluency." },
    { question: "What role does phonetic training play?", answer: "Understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and sound production helps target specific pronunciation issues." },
    { question: "How do mouth and tongue position affect sounds?", answer: "Slight changes in tongue placement or lip shape create different vowels and consonants — awareness aids precision." },
    { question: "Can singing improve pronunciation?", answer: "Yes — singing emphasizes rhythm, stress, and vowel clarity, which transfer to spoken language." },
    { question: "What's the risk of focusing too much on accent?", answer: "It can distract from grammar, vocabulary, and fluency — communication matters more than perfect pronunciation." },
    { question: "Is it possible to completely lose your native accent?", answer: "Very rare — most people retain some features of their L1 accent, especially if learning L2 after childhood." },
    { question: "How does code-switching relate to accent?", answer: "Bilinguals may shift accents depending on context, audience, or language, demonstrating linguistic flexibility." },
    { question: "What's the difference between accent and dialect?", answer: "Accent is about pronunciation; dialect includes grammar and vocabulary differences as well." },
    { question: "Can accent reflect identity positively?", answer: "Absolutely — accents signal cultural heritage, regional pride, and linguistic diversity, enriching global communication." },
    { question: "What is 'accent bias'?", answer: "Unfair judgment or discrimination based on how someone speaks, despite equal linguistic competence." },
    { question: "How can you combat accent bias?", answer: "By educating others on linguistic diversity, emphasizing intelligibility over conformity, and celebrating multilingualism." },
    { question: "Why is Global English important at C2 level?", answer: "Because C2 speakers engage internationally, requiring awareness of diverse accents and the ability to communicate across varieties." }
