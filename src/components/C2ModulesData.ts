    { question: "How do cultural differences affect humor interpretation?", answer: "Humor depends on shared assumptions. British understatement may seem cold to Americans, while slapstick humor may appear immature to some cultures." },
    { question: "Why is timing essential in humor?", answer: "Humor relies on rhythm and anticipation. A perfectly timed pause before the punchline transforms language into performance." },
    { question: "How can humor serve as social criticism?", answer: "Satire and parody use laughter as a mirror to expose injustice, hypocrisy, and moral absurdity while keeping audiences entertained." },

    { question: "How can humor fail across cultures?", answer: "Without shared knowledge, jokes lose meaning or offend. The same phrase can provoke laughter or discomfort depending on context." },
    { question: "How does tone convey sarcasm?", answer: "Tone is the soul of sarcasm. Flat delivery or exaggerated stress signals that literal meaning is inverted." },
    { question: "What role does irony play in literature?", answer: "It deepens narrative complexity by juxtaposing appearance and reality, forcing readers to uncover deeper truths." },
    { question: "Why do some societies embrace dark humor?", answer: "Because laughter transforms fear into resilience. In tragedy, humor offers emotional distance and survival." },
    { question: "How does sarcasm reveal power dynamics?", answer: "Sarcasm often reflects hierarchy — the powerful mock the weak, or vice versa. It can affirm control or challenge authority." },
    { question: "How does understatement create humor?", answer: "By saying less than expected, understatement invites listeners to perceive the unspoken truth — a hallmark of British irony." },
    { question: "What is the danger of humor in formal contexts?", answer: "Misjudged humor can appear unprofessional or disrespectful. In diplomacy or business, tone is everything." },
    { question: "How is humor used politically?", answer: "Politicians use humor strategically to deflect criticism, humanize themselves, or subtly ridicule opponents." },
    { question: "How can irony make serious subjects approachable?", answer: "Irony uses laughter to lower defenses, allowing difficult issues to be explored safely and thoughtfully." },
    { question: "Why is satire considered intellectual humor?", answer: "It requires cultural knowledge and inferential thinking. Recognizing satire means perceiving both surface and subtext." },
    { question: "Why is context crucial for sarcasm?", answer: "Because meaning depends on shared understanding — without it, sarcasm becomes confusion or offense." },
    { question: "How can humor unite people socially?", answer: "Shared laughter creates bonding, reducing tension and reinforcing group identity across differences." },
    { question: "What links intelligence and humor?", answer: "Both rely on recognizing patterns, contradictions, and absurdities — humor is the wit of reason." },

    { question: "How does humor evolve with education?", answer: "Intellectual maturity favors layered humor — irony, wordplay, and cultural allusion over slapstick." },
    { question: "Why is sarcasm called the 'lowest form of wit'?", answer: "Because it can be cruel and superficial, yet when used wisely, it transforms pain into insight." },

    { question: "Why do jokes lose power in translation?", answer: "Humor depends on cultural idioms, wordplay, and timing — all language-specific elements." },
    { question: "Can irony express sincerity?", answer: "Yes — by highlighting absurdity, irony can underscore truth, revealing authenticity through contrast." },
    { question: "How is humor tied to empathy?", answer: "It requires awareness of others' feelings and boundaries, balancing laughter with respect." },
    { question: "How does irony appear in social media?", answer: "Through memes, exaggerated tone, and emojis that signal nonliteral intent — a digital evolution of sarcasm." },
    { question: "Why does self-deprecating humor build credibility?", answer: "Because it signals emotional security and transparency — the confident can afford to laugh at themselves." },
    { question: "What linguistic structures reveal sarcasm?", answer: "Inversion, hyperbole, and positive phrasing with negative tone — often recognizable by prosody alone." },
    { question: "How do authors use dramatic irony?", answer: "Readers know truths that characters do not — creating tension, humor, or empathy through awareness." },
    { question: "How is humor both inclusive and exclusive?", answer: "It unites insiders through shared understanding but excludes outsiders unaware of the reference." },
    { question: "Why does irony thrive during crises?", answer: "Humor becomes resilience — a psychological shield that turns despair into shared strength." },

    { question: "Is accent reduction necessary?", answer: "Only if intelligibility is genuinely compromised — many accents are perfectly clear and don't need modification." },
    { question: "What are common pronunciation challenges for learners?", answer: "Distinguishing /r/ and /l/, /th/ sounds, vowel length, word stress, and intonation patterns." },
    { question: "How can you improve pronunciation clarity?", answer: "Practice minimal pairs, record yourself, focus on word stress and intonation, and listen actively to native speakers." },
    { question: "What are minimal pairs?", answer: "Word pairs differing by one sound, like 'ship/sheep' or 'bit/beat', used to practice sound distinctions." },
    { question: "Why is word stress important?", answer: "Incorrect stress can confuse meaning — 'REcord' (noun) vs. 'reCORD' (verb) are different words." },
    { question: "How does intonation affect meaning?", answer: "Rising intonation signals questions; falling signals statements — misusing it can confuse listeners." },
    { question: "Can you have a strong accent and still be fluent?", answer: "Absolutely — fluency is about communication effectiveness, not sounding native." },
    { question: "What is the Lingua Franca Core?", answer: "A set of pronunciation features deemed essential for international intelligibility in English." },
    { question: "What does the Lingua Franca Core prioritize?", answer: "Consonant clarity, vowel length contrasts, and nuclear stress — not native-like accent." },
    { question: "Should learners imitate a specific accent?", answer: "Only if desired for personal or professional reasons — otherwise, focus on clarity and consistency." },
    { question: "How does exposure improve pronunciation?", answer: "Listening to diverse accents trains the ear and helps internalize natural rhythm, stress, and intonation." },
    { question: "Can shadowing help with accent?", answer: "Yes — repeating speech immediately after hearing it (shadowing) improves rhythm, stress, and fluency." },
    { question: "What role does phonetic training play?", answer: "Understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and sound production helps target specific pronunciation issues." },
    { question: "How do mouth and tongue position affect sounds?", answer: "Slight changes in tongue placement or lip shape create different vowels and consonants — awareness aids precision." },
    { question: "Can singing improve pronunciation?", answer: "Yes — singing emphasizes rhythm, stress, and vowel clarity, which transfer to spoken language." },
    { question: "What's the risk of focusing too much on accent?", answer: "It can distract from grammar, vocabulary, and fluency — communication matters more than perfect pronunciation." },
    { question: "Is it possible to completely lose your native accent?", answer: "Very rare — most people retain some features of their L1 accent, especially if learning L2 after childhood." },
    { question: "How does code-switching relate to accent?", answer: "Bilinguals may shift accents depending on context, audience, or language, demonstrating linguistic flexibility." },
    { question: "What's the difference between accent and dialect?", answer: "Accent is about pronunciation; dialect includes grammar and vocabulary differences as well." },
    { question: "Can accent reflect identity positively?", answer: "Absolutely — accents signal cultural heritage, regional pride, and linguistic diversity, enriching global communication." },
    { question: "What is 'accent bias'?", answer: "Unfair judgment or discrimination based on how someone speaks, despite equal linguistic competence." },
    { question: "How can you combat accent bias?", answer: "By educating others on linguistic diversity, emphasizing intelligibility over conformity, and celebrating multilingualism." },
    { question: "Why is Global English important at C2 level?", answer: "Because C2 speakers engage internationally, requiring awareness of diverse accents and the ability to communicate across varieties." }

Subtle humor relies on wit, ambiguity, and language-based playfulness rather than obvious jokes. It may involve puns, irony, understatement, and cultural references. Subtle humor depends on context, tone, and timing — unlike slapstick or sarcasm, it's intelligent, quiet, and witty. The humor comes from the mind, not the mouth volume.`,

    ]
  },
  speakingPractice: [
    { question: "What kind of humor do you find most intelligent?", answer: "I find subtle humor fascinating because it challenges your mind rather than your reflexes. A single sentence can hide multiple meanings, and you need to catch the hidden twist. It feels like solving a linguistic puzzle." },
    { question: "Why is wordplay considered a sign of linguistic intelligence?", answer: "Because it shows mastery over the language — you must understand sounds, meanings, and idioms deeply to twist them creatively." },
    { question: "Do you think puns are funny or annoying?", answer: "It depends on the delivery. A well-timed pun can make everyone laugh; a forced one feels childish. Timing and context make the difference." },
    { question: "How does cultural background affect the way we understand humor?", answer: "Humor is tied to shared references. A British person might laugh at dry irony, while someone from another culture might not even realize it was a joke." },
    { question: "Can artificial intelligence understand subtle humor?", answer: "Partially. It can detect patterns and tone, but true humor involves emotion and shared human experience — something AI still struggles to replicate." },
    { question: "Why do some people prefer sarcasm over wordplay?", answer: "Sarcasm feels direct and emotional, while wordplay is intellectual. People choose based on personality and mood." },
    { question: "Give an example of a pun you recently heard.", answer: "I heard someone say, 'I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down.' It's simple but clever." },
    { question: "How do you react when people don't get your joke?", answer: "I usually smile and move on. Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog — you understand it better, but it dies in the process." },
    { question: "Is subtle humor useful in professional communication?", answer: "Absolutely. It lightens the atmosphere without being unprofessional, showing that you're confident and emotionally intelligent." },
    { question: "What's the difference between wit and sarcasm?", answer: "Wit is clever and harmless; sarcasm often aims to sting. Wit invites people to laugh with you, sarcasm makes them laugh at someone." },
    { question: "Have you ever misunderstood a joke?", answer: "Yes, especially in another language. I once took a British understatement literally — they said, 'It's not bad,' meaning 'It's excellent.'" },
    { question: "How can humor strengthen relationships?", answer: "Shared laughter builds connection. Subtle humor shows empathy and helps people feel comfortable without being offensive." },
    { question: "What's your favorite example of wordplay in advertising?", answer: "I love 'Nothing runs like a Deere.' It's a pun on 'runs' referring both to machinery and movement." },
    { question: "Why is it harder to translate jokes than normal text?", answer: "Because humor relies on sound, double meanings, and culture. When you translate, you lose those layers." },
    { question: "Can humor be a form of intelligence?", answer: "Definitely. Quick wit shows fast thinking, cultural awareness, and creativity — all signs of high cognitive ability." },
    { question: "What's a situation where humor helped you avoid conflict?", answer: "Once, during a tense meeting, I said, 'Let's argue after coffee — we'll be more productive with caffeine.' It eased the tension instantly." },
    { question: "How do comedians use timing in subtle humor?", answer: "They pause at the right moment — silence becomes part of the joke. The pause builds anticipation and makes the punchline stronger." },
    { question: "What's the risk of using irony in multicultural settings?", answer: "Irony can be mistaken for sincerity. Without shared context, it may confuse or offend." },
    { question: "How do British and American humor differ?", answer: "British humor tends to be dry, ironic, and subtle; American humor is more direct, physical, and story-based." },
    { question: "Do you use self-deprecating humor?", answer: "Yes, I often make fun of myself lightly. It makes others comfortable and prevents me from sounding arrogant." },
    { question: "Why does subtle humor require emotional intelligence?", answer: "Because you need to sense how much your audience can handle — what's funny to one person might be offensive to another." },
    { question: "How does wordplay enhance language learning?", answer: "It forces you to think beyond literal meanings and notice how language works, making learning more creative and memorable." },
    { question: "Can humor exist without words?", answer: "Yes, body language, facial expressions, and even silence can be humorous. But wordplay is unique because it exists within language." },
    { question: "What kind of humor is common in literature?", answer: "Irony, paradox, and understatement. Writers like Oscar Wilde or Mark Twain mastered subtle humor through language precision." },

Satire is a sophisticated form of humor that exposes foolishness, hypocrisy, or corruption using wit, irony, exaggeration, and parody. Unlike pure comedy, satire aims to provoke thought and reform, not just laughter. Satire often uses double meaning, parody, irony, or hyperbole, and readers must decode it carefully — what's said is often the opposite of what's meant.`,

    { question: "How does satire differ from pure comedy?", answer: "Comedy entertains; satire exposes. Comedy makes you laugh, satire makes you think why you're laughing." },
    { question: "Can satire exist without humor?", answer: "Rarely. Humor is the sugar that makes the criticism easier to swallow, but the message is always serious underneath." },
    { question: "Why is satire considered powerful?", answer: "Because it says what people are afraid to say directly. It uses laughter as a shield for truth." },
    { question: "What's an example of satire in literature?", answer: "George Orwell's Animal Farm is a perfect example. The animals represent political figures, and the story mocks dictatorship and propaganda." },
    { question: "How does exaggeration strengthen satire?", answer: "By pushing reality to absurd levels, exaggeration reveals how ridiculous real situations already are." },
    { question: "Can satire ever go too far?", answer: "Yes. When satire becomes too cruel or loses its moral point, it turns into mockery rather than meaningful criticism." },
    { question: "How do you identify irony in satirical writing?", answer: "If the words say one thing but the tone or context suggests the opposite, that's irony — a hallmark of satire." },

  intro: `📘 Lesson Objectives

Intertextuality refers to the network of relationships among texts. Every text is connected to others — by direct quotation, allusion, parody, or thematic echo. In academic writing, it appears through citations and references; in literature, it appears through reinterpretation or response. Recognizing intertextuality allows readers to appreciate deeper meanings and contexts — texts never exist in isolation.`,

    { question: "What's 'dialogism' according to Bakhtin?", answer: "It's the idea that every word and text is in dialogue with what came before and what will follow — language itself is relational." },
    { question: "Why is intertextuality essential in cultural analysis?", answer: "Because culture is cumulative — every story, image, or song reuses earlier symbols to express new meanings." },

    { question: "What's the danger of overusing intertextuality?", answer: "If a text relies too heavily on others, it can lose originality or alienate readers unfamiliar with the references." },
    { question: "How can intertextuality make writing more persuasive?", answer: "By aligning your argument with respected sources, it increases authority and depth." },
    { question: "Is originality possible in an intertextual world?", answer: "Originality lies in the combination and reinterpretation of influences — not in total isolation." },
    { question: "How can authors subvert classical texts?", answer: "By retelling them from new perspectives, e.g., Wide Sargasso Sea retells Jane Eyre from the madwoman's view." },

Ambiguity and vagueness are not always mistakes — they're part of natural language. At the C2 level, a speaker must recognize, analyze, and control them. Ambiguity occurs when a word or sentence has more than one interpretation, while vagueness refers to lack of precision or detail. Effective communicators know when to be precise and when to be intentionally vague for diplomacy, persuasion, or politeness.`,

    { question: "Why do people use vague expressions?", answer: "To be polite, indirect, or flexible. For example, saying 'a bit expensive' instead of 'too expensive' sounds softer." },
    { question: "How does context resolve ambiguity?", answer: "Context tells us which meaning fits. 'Bank' could mean a riverbank or a financial institution — the sentence decides." },
    { question: "What is hedging in communication?", answer: "It's using cautious words like 'probably,' 'sort of,' or 'it seems.' It protects the speaker from sounding too certain." },

    { question: "How can tone affect the interpretation of vague statements?", answer: "Tone can clarify intention. 'That's interesting' could mean sincere praise or polite avoidance." },
    { question: "What's the difference between literal and intended meaning?", answer: "Literal meaning is what's said; intended meaning is what's meant — listeners infer it from tone and context." },
