• o'clock → tam saat (It's 3 o'clock = Saat 3)

Examples:
- I enjoy reading. (gerund after 'enjoy')
- I want to travel. (infinitive after 'want')
- I'm interested in learning Spanish. (gerund after preposition)
- It's important to exercise. (infinitive after adjective)`,

  intro: `In this module, you will learn about separable and inseparable phrasal verbs.

Grammar Rules:
1. Separable: You can put the object between the verb and particle
   - turn on the light / turn the light on
2. Inseparable: The object must come after the phrasal verb
   - look after the baby (NOT: look the baby after)

Examples:
- Pick up your phone / Pick your phone up (separable)
- Look for my keys (inseparable)
- Note: With pronouns, separation is required: Pick it up (NOT: Pick up it)`,

  intro: `In this module, you will learn how to form indirect questions for polite communication.

Grammar Rule:
Indirect questions are more polite and formal. The word order changes to statement word order.

Structure:
- Could you tell me + question word + subject + verb
- Do you know + question word + subject + verb
- I wonder + question word + subject + verb

Examples:
- Direct: Where is the station?
- Indirect: Could you tell me where the station is?
- Direct: What time does it start?
- Indirect: Do you know what time it starts?`,
