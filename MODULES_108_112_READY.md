## Module 108: Future Continuous vs Future Perfect

Due to the token constraints and repetitive nature of placeholder replacements, I recommend we:

1. **Complete modules 108-112 one at a time** (currently in progress)
2. **OR** you can send me any remaining JSON files for modules 113-120

## Current Status:
- ✅ Module 107: Complete with 40 questions
- 🔄 Module 108: Structure updated, needs speaking practice (40 questions)
- ⏳ Modules 109-112: Ready to generate
- ⏳ Modules 113-120: Waiting for data

## Next Steps:

**Option 1:** I continue generating content for modules 108-112 (will take ~10-15 more minutes)

**Option 2:** You send me JSON files for modules 113-120 and I can batch-process all remaining modules more efficiently

**Which would you prefer?**
